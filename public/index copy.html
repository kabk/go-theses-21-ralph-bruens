        As the Internet is more and more surveilled and centralized, its "dark" counterpart, The Dark Web, has become
        more relevant as a place to connect. Meanwhile, anonymity is often considered as something suspicious. The Dark
        Web sparks my curiosity. It seals and holds something mystical around itself. Is this because it is harder to
        access than the 'normal' internet, or maybe because the anonymity of the Dark Web is convenient for criminal
        activities and I might find myself in a space that is dangerous?

        This thesis intends to find out what the potentials are for an anonymous space such as the Dark Web. Why is
        there a 'dark' version of the web? I wish to explore the Dark Web. First, I wish to contextualize the Dark Web,
        what is the system behind it, and how does it work. Therefore, I need to go on field research and experience the
        Dark Web for myself. Additionally, end with a part in which artists have responded on surveillance, being
        monitored, digital footprints, missing and creating anonymity that form the context of the Dark Web.

        Society has reached a point where it is no longer possible to avoid the internet. The users' body, mind and
        behaviours are linked to a digital realm with mediation apps, smart TV's and even Wi-Fi connected fridges.
        Often, we see the internet as a democratic and borderless network, where people can meet and communicate. Yet,
        we are witnessing a shift where the internet loses its decentralized structure to a central model. Data is
        stored and managed in the ‘cloud’ which is owned by a small amount of companies. With the 'cloud' we have access
        to our documents, photos and videos from any place at any time. These files are on servers, part of a datacentre
        located somewhere, where a governments law inevitably applies. However, governmental law enforcements could
        demand datacentres to hand over data even from outside their own borders. For example, all data that are stored
        on datacentres of US companies – think about Google or Microsoft – fall under the USA Patriot Act which allows
        the US government to force those companies to hand over personal user data, even if the datacentres are located
        outside the States. As a result, non-US users can be surveilled and monitored by US authorities. What would stop
        a government from using surveillance to target political opponents, journalists, critics or innocent citizens?
