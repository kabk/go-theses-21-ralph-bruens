        As the Internet is more and more surveilled and centralized, its "dark" counterpart, The Dark Web, has become
        more relevant as a place to connect. Meanwhile, anonymity is often considered as something suspicious. The Dark
        Web sparks my curiosity. It seals and holds something mystical around itself. Is this because it is harder to
        access than the 'normal' internet, or maybe because the anonymity of the Dark Web is convenient for criminal
        activities and I might find myself in a space that is dangerous?
      </p>
      <p class='text-xl leading-7 text-purple-600 p-4'>
        This thesis intends to find out what the potentials are for an anonymous space such as the Dark Web. Why is
        there a 'dark' version of the web? I wish to explore the Dark Web. First, I wish to contextualize the Dark Web,
        what is the system behind it, and how does it work. Therefore, I need to go on field research and experience the
        Dark Web for myself. Additionally, end with a part in which artists have responded on surveillance, being
        monitored, digital footprints, missing and creating anonymity that form the context of the Dark Web.

        Society has reached a point where it is no longer possible to avoid the internet. The users' body, mind and
        behaviours are linked to a digital realm with mediation apps, smart TV's and even Wi-Fi connected fridges.
        Often, we see the internet as a democratic and borderless network, where people can meet and communicate. Yet,
        we are witnessing a shift where the internet loses its decentralized structure to a central model.
        Data is stored and managed in the ‘cloud’ which is owned by a small amount of companies.
        <sup class='text-purple-600' id='fn2'>[2]</sup>
        With the 'cloud' we have access to our documents, photos and videos from any place at any time. These files are
        on servers, part of a datacentre located somewhere, where a governments law inevitably applies. However,
        governmental law enforcements
        could demand datacentres to hand over data even from outside their own borders. For example, all data that are
        stored on datacentres of US companies – think about Google or Microsoft – fall under the USA Patriot Act which
        allows the US government to force those companies to hand over personal user data, even if the datacentres are
        located outside the States.<sup class='text-purple-600' id='fn3'>[3]</sup> As a result, non-US users can be
        surveilled and monitored by US authorities. What
        would stop a government from using surveillance to target political opponents, journalists, critics or innocent
        citizens?

        The discourse about anonymity on the internet becomes even more urgent. United Nations Special Rapporteur David
        Kaye stated: "Encryption and anonymity, today's leading vehicles for online security, provide individuals with a
        means to protect their privacy, empowering them to browse, read, develop and share opinions and information
        without interference and enabling [them] the rights to freedom of opinion and expression".<sup class='text-purple-600' id='fn4'>[4]</sup> However, remaining
        effectively anonymous on the internet for a long time is extremely difficult and requires some knowledge and
        discipline. You can use fewer and fewer services anonymously. Many platforms already ask for identification –
        verified profiles are far more interesting to them than anonymous ones. Thereby, websites that offers anonymity,
        such as 4chan, often portraited by mass media as "the dark corners of the internet" .<sup class='text-purple-600' id='fn5'>[5]</sup> A Dutch graphic design
        duo specialized in speculative design, Metahaven, discussed this in their book ‘Black Transparency’: "Almost all
        antidotes to global surveillance goes under shades of black". <sup class='text-purple-600' id='fn6'>[6]</sup> In an era of massive surveillance, working with
        (encrypted) anonymity is often seen as suspicious behaviour. The same anonymity the Dark Web can provide.

      For me personally, the Dark Web is nothing more than a myth. An online version of Pandora's box. Metahaven goes on to say; "The 'darknet' or the 'Dark Web' is a term often used for a shady internet underworld that sports illicit black markets[...]". 6 However, my interest in the Dark Web focusses less on the unethical activities on the Dark Web. In this research I try to explore the potential of the Dark Web's anonymity in an era where the internet surveillance plays an increasingly important role.
