          As the internet is more and more surveilled and centralized, its ‘dark’ counterpart, The Dark Web, has
          become
          more relevant as a place to connect. Meanwhile, anonymity is often considered as something suspicious. The
          Dark
          Web sparks my curiosity. It seals and holds something mystical around itself. Is this because it is harder
          to
          access than the 'normal' internet, or maybe because the anonymity of the Dark Web is convenient for criminal
          activities and I might find myself in a space that is dangerous?
        </p>
        <p class='text-xl leading-6 text-black-600 pt-0 p-4'>
          This thesis intends to find out what the potentials are for an anonymous space such as the Dark Web. Why is
          there a 'dark' version of the web? I wish to explore the Dark Web. First, I wish to contextualize the Dark
          Web,
          what is the system behind it, and how does it work. Therefore, I need to go on field research and experience
          the
          Dark Web for myself. Additionally, I will end this thesis with a part in which artists have responded on
          surveillance, being monitored, digital footprints, missing and creating anonymity that form the context of
          the
          Dark Web.

          "The Internet does not exist. Maybe it did exist only a short time ago, but now it only remains as a blur
          […]"
          <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">[1]</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p class='tracking-tight text-xl leading-6 text-black-600 p-4' ;>
          Society has reached a point where it is no longer possible to avoid the internet. The users' body, mind and
          behaviours are linked to a digital realm with mediation apps, smart TV's and even Wi-Fi connected fridges.
          Often, we see the internet as a democratic and borderless network, where people can meet and communicate.
          Yet,
          we are witnessing a shift where the internet loses its decentralized structure to a central model.
          Data is stored and managed in the ‘cloud’ which is owned by a small amount of companies.
          <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">[2]</a></sup>
          With the 'cloud' we have access to our documents, photos and videos from any place at any time. These files
          are
          on servers, part of a datacentre located somewhere, where a governments law inevitably applies. However,
          governmental law enforcements
          could demand datacentres to hand over data even from outside their own borders. For example, all data that
          are
          stored on datacentres of US companies – think about Google or Microsoft – fall under the USA Patriot Act
          which
          allows the US government to force those companies to hand over personal user data, even if the datacentres
          are
          located outside the States.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">[3]</a></sup> As a result,
          non-US users can be
          surveilled and monitored by US authorities. What
          would stop a government from using surveillance to target political opponents, journalists, critics or
          innocent
          citizens?
        </p>



        <p class='tracking-tight text-xl leading-6 text-black-600 p-4' ;>
          The discourse about anonymity on the internet becomes even more urgent. United Nations Special Rapporteur
          David
          Kaye stated: <i>"Encryption and anonymity, today's leading vehicles for online security, provide individuals
          with a
          means to protect their privacy, empowering them to browse, read, develop and share opinions and information
          without interference and enabling [them] the rights to freedom of opinion and expression".</i>
          <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">[4]</a></sup> However, remaining
          effectively anonymous on the internet for a long time is extremely difficult and requires some knowledge and
          discipline. You can use fewer and fewer services anonymously. Many platforms already ask for identification
          –
          verified profiles are far more interesting to them than anonymous ones. Thereby, websites that offers
          anonymity,
          such as 4chan, often portraited by mass media as <i>"the dark corners of the internet"</i> .<sup id="fnref:5"><a
              href="#fn:5" class="footnote">[5]</a></sup>
          A Dutch graphic design
          duo specialized in speculative design, Metahaven, discussed this in their book ‘Black Transparency’: "Almost
          all
          antidotes to global surveillance goes under shades of black". <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6"
              class="footnote">[6]</a></sup> In
          an era of massive surveillance, working with
          (encrypted) anonymity is often seen as suspicious behaviour. The same anonymity the Dark Web can provide.

        <p class='tracking-tight text-xl leading-6 text-black-600 p-4' ;>
          For me personally, the Dark Web is nothing more than a myth. An online version of Pandora's box. Metahaven
          goes
          on to say; <i>"The 'darknet' or the 'Dark Web' is a term often used for a shady internet underworld that sports
          illicit black markets[...]".</i>
          <sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">[6]</a></sup> However, my interest in the Dark Web
          focusses less on the
          unethical activities on the Dark Web. In this research I try to explore the potential of the Dark Web's
          anonymity in an era where the internet surveillance plays an increasingly important role.

        <p class='tracking-tight text-xl leading-6 text-black-600 pt-0 p-4'>
          In order to get a better view, I decided to divide the internet into three categories. The first part is the
          so-called Surface Web. The Surface Web is the part of the internet that we can consider as publicly
          accessible.
          In order to reach this part, there is no authentication or payment required. All websites are indexed and
          possible to be found by search engines. Also, it is possible, due to IP addresses, to identify online
          traffic.
          <br>
          Some websites make use of security systems by using login details, by using authentication methods, such as
          bank
          details or social media accounts. The information from the internet in this part is deeply hidden and is
          therefore called the Deep Web. We cannot access this part of the internet without some form of
          authentication,
          nor is it indexed by search engines. Following this definition, academic and medical databases are also
          examples
          of the Deep Web. However, this does not mean that the user or the servers themselves are anonymous. Your
          online
          footsteps are still clearly visible because you are still logging into a public server.
        </p>

        <p class='tracking-tight text-xl leading-6 text-black-600 pt-0 p-4' ;>
          The last category is the Dark Web. This part is a network consisting of millions of different websites.
          These
          websites are only accessible via encrypted tools that make IP addresses no longer readable.
          <sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">[7]</a></sup> To use these tools,
          you need special software. The big difference between the Surface Web and Dark Web is that the Dark Web,
          through
          encryption, allows the user to remain fully anonymous. Encryption has been a centuries-old method to 'hide'
          messages. For example, Julius Caesar used two different alphabets. One regular alphabet, and one with shift
          in
          it. Today we call this method of encryption the Caesar Cipher. Spartans also used encryption, but
          differently;
          for example, people wrote a message on a parchment piece. It was only legible if you rolled the paper around
          a
          stick of the correct diameter. <sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">[8]</a></sup>This kept the
          message anonymous to
          any intermediaries. Anonymity made the Dark
          Web best known for its trade in forbidden substances. The existence of the Dark Web became publicly known
          after
          the most extensive online drug bazaar, The Silk Road, was shut down in 2013. <sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9"
              class="footnote">[9]</a></sup>
          Because the Dark Web isn’t indexed
          and users are anonymous, people often see it as a separate network. In fact, the Dark Web is a part of the
          internet. Yet, the Dark Web is an open network. An open network means that the anyone can access the Dark
          Web as
          long as the user has a connection to a server. It offers a space for people who consider anonymity and
          privacy
          important. It is of interest to citizens from dictatorial countries with strict censorship policies, human
          rights activists and journalists.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">[10]</a></sup>

          Even though I am a registered member of Instagram, so indirectly Facebook, and I have a Twitter and Google
          account, I think it is a matter of principle to choose anonymity on the internet. I believe anonymity
          provides
          freedom and freedom is one of the fundamental ideas behind the emergence of the internet and the Dark Web.
          <sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote">[11]</a></sup>
          The origins of a democratic and free network go way back in time. In the shadow of the moon landing in 1969,
          people
          were working on a communication system called ARPANET. ARPANET was an experimental computer network that
          became
          the foundation of the internet as we know it today. This network was a system that enabled communication
          between
          devices for the first time; ARPANET started as an invention for academia to exchange ideas freely. Due to
          its
          success, the US military, which was dealing with the Cold War, also quickly took advantage of it.
        </p>

        <p class='text-xl leading-6 tracking-tight text-black-600 pt-0 p-4' ;>
          As the US government unleashed ARPANET over the years, the researchers, who mainly worked at universities
          across
          the country, were given more freedom to try radical experiments. This created baby shoes for illegal
          transactions. John Markoff explains it his book ‘What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture
          Shaped
          the Personal Computer industry'.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote">[12]</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p class='text-xl leading-6 tracking-tight text-black-600 pt-0 p-4' ;>
          <i> "In 1971 or 1972, Stanford students using ARPANET accounts from Stanford University's Artificial
          Intelligence
          Laboratory had a commercial transaction with their Massachusetts Institute of Technology counterparts.
          Before
          Amazon, before eBay, e-commerce was a drug deal. The students used the network to quietly control the sale
          of an
          indefinite amount of marijuana".</i> <sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote">[13]</a></sup>
        </p>

        <p class='text-xl leading-6 tracking-tight text-black-600 pt-0 p-4' ;>
          This freedom allowed researchers to try daring experiments, such as creating marketplaces for selling
          contraband
          goods, which correlates to the Dark Web's fame and myths. In the early 1980s, the founders of ARPANET
          decided to
          split from the government body. The splitting led to the emergence of a military branch Creatively called,
          MILNET. ARPANET continued under the same name and remained a breeding ground for experiments without any
          control
          from government agencies and became the basis of what our internet yielded.
          <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote">[14]</a></sup>
          You can see that today the
          internet is partly based on the idea of ARPANET. For example, our mail system still works with the automated
          process between two users as it was intended more than 50 years ago. </p>

        <p class='text-xl leading-6 tracking-tight text-black-600 pt-0 p-4' ;>
          Since the internet is more and more developed, there has been an increasing call for online privacy. In
          2008, an
          answer came to this growing demand, The TOR Browser (TOR). TOR is the best known and most used tool for
          entering
          today's Dark Web. Its origins lie with the United States Department of Defence.
          In the late 1990s, a research organization called U.S. Naval Research Lab (NRL) developed an anonymized
          network
          that uses cryptography. Safety issues made it easy for secret missions to been monitored or taken offline.
          As a
          result, the US Department of Defence (US DoD) created a communication system without a central core, much
          like
          ARPANET, which would protect against opposition attacks that would attempt to shut down the system simply by
          destroying the core. <sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote">[14]</a></sup> The US DoD wanted
          to achieve this with the
          idea of routing internet traffic through
          multiple nodes and those are sealed, every step with encryption.<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15"
              class="footnote">[15]</a></sup>
          This method got its name from the idea of an
          onion that has to be peeled before the core is visible, and it is called ‘onion routing’. In early 2000,
          Roger
          Dingledine started working on a new NRL routing project together with Paul Syverson. They call this project:
          TOR, which stood for The Onion Router. Dingledine and Syverson wanted to give it a name to stand out from
          other
          onion routing projects popping up elsewhere. This project aimed to find a way to use the internet with as
          much
          privacy as possible. In 2004, the project developed the so-called ‘hidden services’. They also started
          developing bridges to the TOR network to address censorship, such as bypassing government firewalls. TOR
          began
          to gain popularity among activists and tech-savvy users interested in privacy, but it the entry barrier was
          too
          steep for the less tech-savvy to reach the network yet. To make it easier to access, the TOR-project created
          the
          TOR browser in 2008. Nowadays, we can no longer ignore TOR when we talk about the Dark Web, so I downloaded
          the
          browser to do field research. </p>

        <p class='text-l  tracking-tight text-black-600 text-center font-bold pt-0 '>EXPOLRE. PRIVATELY.</p>
        <p class='text-xl leading-6 tracking-tight text-black-600 pt-0 p-4' ;>Once I opened the TOR browser application, I found a purple Website with the text <i>"Browse Privately. Explore
          Freely."</i> So, I tried to explore. Privately. Without any idea of using TOR, I tried to put in some terms in
          the
          search bar. Nothing happened, unfortunately, but only logical. The Dark Web uses ‘hidden services’, and they
          wouldn't be ‘hidden’ if they were so easy to access. All Websites on the Dark Web are sealed with
          encryption,
          and to enter a website, you need an onion link. TOR does not use ‘dot-org’ or ‘dot-com’ suffixes but
          ‘dot-onion’. There are several ways to get a hidden service link. My method was making use of the anonymous
          Web
          forum 4chan. There I found plenty of different URLs. But this link was the most common:</p>

          With this link, I could find my way through the Dark Web, I was told. I copied the URL and pasted it into
          the
          address bar of the TOR browser and hit enter. Loading takes longer than usual, but eventually, I ended up on
          a
          Website called ‘Hidden Wiki’. This Website consists of many different hyperlinks. The first thing I noticed
          during the first few minutes on the Dark Web is that it is very limited. The aesthetics lacks some layering.
          It
          is mostly done in global HTML structure, with an H1 header and text in Arial or Times New Roman; This is
          partly
          due to the limiting consequences of using encryption. For example, it does support any additional scripts
          such
          as JavaScript. At first glance, navigating the Dark Web is like unpacking a package. Without knowing what to
          expect, you are constantly clicking on various hyperlinks, which act as a kind of gateway to new
          information.
          Yet, without all the limitation, TOR works the same as other browsers. </p>

        <p class='text-xl leading-6 tracking-tight text-black-600 pt-0 p-4' ;>
          Following the idea of constantly ongoing gateways we can talk about a network. However, a network is a very
          broad concept. A network could be physical or non-physical. To define a network, Sociologist Manuel Castells
          gives a clear definition in his text ‘The network society: a cross-cultural perspective’: <i>"A network is a
          set of
          interconnected nodes. A node is the point where the curve intersects itself".</i>
          <sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote">[16]</a></sup>

          <p class='text-xl leading-6 tracking-tight text-black-600 pt-0 p-4' ;>
            The whole internet infrastructure consists out of nodes. The nodes are independent servers that contain
            information and are connected by the internet. Node servers each contain similar programming, making none
            of
            them strictly fundamental to the operation of the network. They can generally be added and removed without
            disrupting the functionality of the internet at all. Each node connects to every other node, shaping a web
            without any central structure. There is neither a start, nor an end. This characteristic follows to the
            rhizome
            concept of Deleuze and Guattari. In the rhizome, as well as the internet, there is no central structure,
            but an
            enormous number of different nodes that connect to each other. In the book ‘A Thousand Plateaus:
            Capitalism and
            Schizophrenia’, Deleuze and Guatarri wrote:<i>"Unlike trees or their roots, the rhizome connects one point to
            every other point, and its properties are not necessarily linked to properties of the same nature".</i>
            <sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote">[17]</a></sup>
          </p>

          <p class='text-xl leading-6 tracking-tight text-black-600 pt-0 p-4' ;>
            These connections, in digital terms, are the hyperlinks. The type of data doesn't influence the relation
            between
            nodes. This makes every connection possible. Unlike a network with the shape of a tree, which always
            starts with
            the root and regardless of the size of the tree always ends at the last branch, a rhizome is infinite. A
            rhizome
            network does not have a finale stage where it will be saturated or done. If one node is destroyed; it will
            be
            replaced by a new one. A rhizome has only stages of appearance. This fact contributes to the next
            characteristic
            of the Dark Web; an endpoint will never be reached. </p>

              Modular Synth Setup of electronic music artist Sam Sheppard, 25 December 2019, by Future.
              Modular Synths are rhizomes. A rhizome is a non-hierarchical method of organization where every point is
              connected to every other point. A modular board works the same, every node is able to connect with cables,
              while it's endlessly expandable with other modular boards. </p>
          </div>

          <p class='text-xl leading-6 tracking-tight text-black-600 pt-0 p-4' ;>
            However, this rhizome nature makes the Dark Web vulnerable. The Dark Web drives on the values of freedom
            and
            privacy. The use of encryption tools like TOR allows users to browse without any interference from third
            parties. It can only encrypt data inside its own network. Yet, a rhizome-like network breaks the limits of
            a
            framed space and opens up new horizons. A node can easily be replaced by a new one which can infect the
            anonymity of the user. A new node can exit the encrypted network. That's why Dark Web needed a ruleset. In
            fact,
            rules counteract the concept of a rhizome. Deleuze talk about limitations and thresholds in a rhizome
            network.
            The limits being the outer limit of network’s ability, the threshold being the point where it
            disintegrates.
            <sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote">[18]</a></sup>
            In case of the Dark Web the limits are the full supported capacity of the network. For example, the Dark
            Web
            capacity stops at the point a server has scripts installed that will save the users browsing data or
            server
            location. The threshold being the point the user goes beyond the 'borders' of the Dark Web. For instance,
            by
            signing in on Facebook with your personal credentials, the user passes the threshold of anonymity and
            crosses
            into the Deep Web. The Dark Web only retains the ability of providing anonymity if the users stay in the
            frameset of those limits and thresholds.

          understand the importance for reclaiming their privacy on the internet.
          <sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote">[21]</a></sup>

          Unfortunately, this non-surveilled network does not only offer space for people with good intentions.
          Criminals,
          hackers, drug dealers, and even pedophiles see anonymity as an opportunity to buy and sell their goods and

            The question is then: Why do we want to be invisible? In the Monty Python movie, I referenced above, Mrs. B.
            J.
            Smegma isn’t seen, and the moment she isn’t spotted, she is safe. But as soon as she shows up, she’s been
            destroyed by an explosion. Should we take this as a metaphor? If we show ourselves, can it work against us?
            Maybe
            whistle-blowers have to be worried about being monitored or found, but does this also apply to a "normal"
            internet
            user? Hito said in an interview with Tate Gallery: <i>“The situation most people face is that they are visible
            all
            the time to certain modes of capture. That's unfortunate, I think because people might want to escape from
            this
            excessive amount of — you know — constant surveillance. On the other hand, being invisible can be deadly".</i>

          <p class='object-center text-xl leading-6 tracking-tight text-black-600 pt-0 px-4'>
            Being fully anonymous and invisible isn't always relevant for most people. However, anonymity isn't only an
            act
            of
            counter-surveillance. Being able to be anonymous online is also important for free self-development. For
            example,
            young people who have doubts about their sexual orientation must be able to search for information
            anonymously
            and
            have a conversation without leaving any traces. </p><br>

        <p class='object-center text-xl leading-6 tracking-tight text-black-600 pt-0 p-4'>
         
          The internet is relatively new, and its influence is multiplying at an incredibly fast rate. Due to these
          rapid
          developments, we also see changes in the ideology of the internet’s purpose. Where the internet was intended
          as
          a place for the free exchange of ideas; we see more and more frameworks are emerging on the Surface Web. The
          growing control on the Surface Web increases the need for privacy and anonymity on the internet. The Dark
          Web
          partly fulfils this requirement, only it is seen as a mythical and obscure place that is difficult to
          access.
        </p>
        <p class='object-center text-xl leading-6 tracking-tight text-black-600 pt-0 p-4'>
          The Dark Web is a rhizome network that will never be done or completed, it is continuously changing. The
          possibility of adapting in a small amount of time makes it possible that if someone takes down a website, it
          is
          easy to reposition elsewhere in the non-hierarchic network. However, this should be done in a within the
          borders
          of an encrypted network. Otherwise it will infect the potential anonymity of the Dark Web </p>

        <p class='object-center text-xl leading-6 tracking-tight text-black-600 pt-0 p-4'>
          The internet plays an increasingly important role in contemporary politics. The Dark Web can offer political
          protection, freedom of speech, and access to information obscured by authorities. Using an encrypted
          connection,
          the Dark Web has become an essential medium for journalists, activists, and political dissidents. But it is
          also
          an important tool for people who do not have direct access to the internet. For example, it can be used as a
          tool
          for places with little or no internet reach, or areas affected by war or disasters by using an independent
          server.
        </p>

        <p class='object-center text-xl leading-6 tracking-tight text-black-600 pt-0 p-4'>
          Currently, research shows that the Dark Web is mostly used by criminals, but its relevance to the world of
          cybercrime is greatly exaggerated. Looking beyond the panic-mongering, the Dark Web is a hopeful medium. In
          essence, it is the internet as it was intended more than 50 years ago. People can freely exchange ideas
          without
          fear of censorship. Anonymity isn't just a tool for countering surveillance. It's a tool for
          self-exploration.
          It
          helps to get access for information for personal questions without leaving any traces. </p>

        <p class='object-center text-xl leading-6 tracking-tight text-black-600 pt-0 p-4'>
          If we look at the overall picture, we see that the implementation of the Dark Web offers many possibilities
          for
          society in general. The internet of today is a screen full of dead pixels, causing that you to miss
          essential
          information. The Dark Web makes these pixels come back to life. Especially as governments and technology
          companies
          continue to darken and censor the Surface Web, the ‘dark’ counterpart becomes relevant as a place to discuss
          and
          connect. I think the resistance should not be aimed at the technology but at the people who abuse it. We
          must
          not
          let the myth of the Dark Web ruin the beauty of not being found. </p><br>

          Influential Surface Web message board where users all post under the name ‘Anonymous’.
          <br><br>
          <b>Dark Web aka darknet</b><br>
          There is often confusion about the term Dark Web. For example, people used to call it darknet. It's not
          wrong
          but darknet is just another name for the Dark Web. The most official authorities are used to called it Dark
          Web.
          <br><br>
          <b>IP aka Internet Protocol</b><br>
          Think of your IP address as your home address, it identifies your device when you are online. However, it
          depends on which connection you have. Your home internet has another IP then the free WIFI of your favourite
          coffee shop.
          <br><br>
          <b>TOR aka The Onion Router</b><br>
          TOR, which stands for The Onion Router, is a browser that allows you to search the internet anonymously. It
          is
          also a browser that people often use to access and search the Dark Web. This browser allows you to browse to
          sites with the dot-onion suffix.
          <br><br>


          <b>Node</b><br>
          A node in a computer network is a server. Some examples of nodes are computers, laptops and routers. On the
          Dark
          Web every node is end-to-end encrypted.
          <br><br>
          <b>Hidden Service</b><br>
          The servers configured to only to receive incoming connections through Tor are called hidden services.
          Rather
          than revealing a server's IP address, a hidden service can be accessed via the onion address.
          <br><br>
          <b>Global HTML structure
          A HTML code exists out of</b><br>
          1. a line containing HTML information,<br>
          2. a header section separated by a head element<br>
          3. a body, which contains the websites content.<br>
          <br><br>
          <b>Bitcoin (crypto currency)</b><br>
          A payment system that is anonymous by using encryption. Very popular currency on (online)black markets.
          <br><br>
          <b>Hacktivists:</b><br>
          A hacktivist is a person who' is using his or hers technological knowledge and the internet as an act of
          protest
          or resistance.
          <br><br>
          <b>Incognito:</b><br>
          In fact, Incognito is a synonym for anonymity. In internet term incognito is seen as a feature in browsers
          that
          the browser does not store your search and navigation history. However, which pages you visit is still
          trackable
          via your IP address. So, you are not completely anoymous.
