        As the Internet is more and more surveilled and centralized, its "dark" counterpart, The Dark Web, has become
        more relevant as a place to connect. Meanwhile, anonymity is often considered as something suspicious. The Dark
        Web sparks my curiosity. It seals <sup class='text-purple-600' id='fn2'>[1]</sup>

        This thesis intends to find out what the potentials are for an anonymous space such as the Dark Web. Why is
        there a 'dark' version of the web? I wish to explore the Dark Web. First, I wish to contextualize the Dark Web,
        what is the system behind it, and how does it work. Therefore, I need to go on field research and experience the
        Dark Web for myself. Additionally, end with a part in which artists have responded on surveillance, being
        monitored, digital footprints, missing and creating anonymity that form the context of the Dark Web.
