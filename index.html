<h1> THE BEAUTY OF NOT BEING FOUND. </h1>

<p>ABSTRACT.</p>
<br>
<p>As the Internet is more and more surveilled and centralized, its "dark" counterpart, The Dark Web, has become more relevant as a place to connect. Meanwhile, anonymity is often considered as something suspicious. The Dark Web sparks my curiosity. It seals and holds something mystical around itself. Is this because it is harder to access than the 'normal' internet, or maybe because the anonymity of the Dark Web is convenient for criminal activities and I might find myself in a space that is dangerous?</p>
<p>This thesis intends to find out what the potentials are for an anonymous space such as the Dark Web. Why is there a 'dark' version of the web? I wish to explore the Dark Web. First, I wish to contextualize the Dark Web, what is the system behind it, and how does it work. Therefore, I need to go on field research and experience the Dark Web for myself. Additionally, end with a part in which artists have responded on surveillance, being monitored, digital footprints, missing and creating anonymity that form the context of the Dark Web.
